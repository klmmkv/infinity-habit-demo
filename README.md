# infinity-habit-demo
A DApp that should help you to upload "Proofs" to the blockchain via IPFS. The DApp itself is unfinished, but shows the foundation of the bigger picture in an pre-MVP Demo. It includes a ERC20, ERC721 contract and has an upload to IPFS function. More Infos in the Slide Deck: https://github.com/klmmkv/infinity-habit-demo
